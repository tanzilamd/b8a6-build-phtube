                            Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            In JavaScript, the scope and behavior of variables
                            are defined by three keywords: var, let, and const.
                            When using var, variables are function-scoped,
                            meaning they are accessible within the function in
                            which they are declared, or globally if declared
                            outside of any function. var variables are hoisted,
                            which means their declarations are moved to the top
                            of their containing function or global scope during
                            compilation, though their assignments are not. They
                            can be reassigned and redeclared within the same
                            scope. On the other hand, let and const introduce
                            block-scoped variables, confined to the block in
                            which they are defined, such as loops or if
                            statements. Both let and const are hoisted as well,
                            but accessing them before their declaration results
                            in a ReferenceError. While let variables can be
                            reassigned within their scope, const variables, once
                            initialized, cannot be changed, making them suitable
                            for constants. Understanding the scope and usage of
                            these variable declaration keywords is essential for
                            writing clean and error-free JavaScript code.

                            Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Both null and undefined serve specific roles in
                            representing the absence of values, but they are
                            used in distinct contexts. undefined is often
                            associated with variables that have been declared
                            but not initialized, missing function parameters, or
                            accessing non-existent object properties. It's a way
                            of indicating that a value is not present or
                            meaningful at a given point in code execution. On
                            the other hand, null is employed when developers
                            want to explicitly assign a variable or property as
                            having no value. It can be used to reset or clear
                            values and serves as a deliberate representation of
                            absence. Understanding when to use null or undefined
                            is essential for writing code that accurately
                            communicates the absence or presence of values in
                            different situations, contributing to code clarity
                            and reliability.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            A REST API, or Representational State Transfer
                            Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules
                            and conventions for building and interacting with
                            web services. It is based on the principles of REST,
                            which stands for Representational State Transfer. In
                            a REST API, resources are represented as unique
                            URLs, and interactions with these resources are
                            carried out using a standardized set of HTTP methods
                            such as GET (to retrieve data), POST (to create new
                            data), PUT (to update data), and DELETE (to remove
                            data). The core idea behind REST is simplicity and
                            scalability. RESTful APIs are designed to be
                            stateless, meaning each request from a client to the
                            server must contain all the information needed to
                            understand and fulfill that request. This simplicity
                            makes REST APIs easy to understand and implement,
                            and they can be used in various contexts, from
                            simple data retrieval to complex interactions
                            between different systems. REST APIs are widely used
                            in web development for building web applications,
                            mobile apps, and other distributed systems. They
                            provide a structured and standardized way for
                            different software components to communicate over
                            the internet, making it easier to build and maintain
                            robust and scalable applications.
